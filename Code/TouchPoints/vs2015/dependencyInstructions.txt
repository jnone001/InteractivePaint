to get latest dependencies clone "https://tamsenior.visualstudio.com/_git/dependencies" from inside this directory

the visual studio build should take care of moving .dll files into the right location, but in case those files get deleted
just rebuild the project or run '$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File CopyDebugx86Dlls.ps1' with the appropriate
powershell script. Or just move the dlls your self lol.
